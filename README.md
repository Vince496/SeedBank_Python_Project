# Vicente's Undergraduate Tesis project.
This repository contains the code conceived as the simulation of the SeedBank model from a complete iteration to the code that statistically verifies the theoretical results on the lengths of the seedbank tree. It includes the following:
  - In the "CSV's" folder, you will find the files used to generate the graphs displayed in the thesis titled "Una simulaci√≥n del Seed-Bank".
  - The file "Coalescent_SeedBank" contains the code used to simulate the Kingman phase and the Kingman phase with freezing.
  - The file "Plots.py" contains the code used to creat the plots as we see on thesis.
  - The file "Coalescent Seed-Bank_Sigma.py" contains the code used to simulate the complete coalescent tree.
  - The file "Coalescent_Seed-Bank_Process.py" contains the code used to simulate the complete coalescent tree of a single experiment, saving all the steps.
